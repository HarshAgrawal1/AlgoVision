# AlgoVision
Streamlined user authentication-driven software enabling CSV file uploads for targeted value predictions, offering automatic algorithm selection based on high accuracy, rich visualization, and user-friendly tutorials for an enhanced learning experience.

I have established a smooth file flow with authentication, utilizing basic principles of system design. In the future, I plan to incorporate CSV file deployment into this non-CSS software for deployment

1. **User Authentication:** Robust login system ensuring secure access to the platform for file uploads and predictions.

5. **System Design Principles:** Implementation ensuring optimized code execution, prompt user responses, and smooth overall system performance.

6. Visualizations Enhancement (Future Development): Future plans to enrich visual representations with more diverse and interactive features to provide deeper insights into predictive outcomes.

7. Tutorial Component Integration (Future Development): Upcoming implementation of comprehensive tutorial components aimed at simplifying user learning and enhancing the overall user experience within the platform.
